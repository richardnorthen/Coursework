overall notes:
- program compiles and executes normally
- valgrind shows no errors or leaks (only possibly / reachable, but so does the demo!)
- I opted to use the provided BoundedBuffer.h implementation
- since the nonblocking methods were guaranteed to return a 0 or 1 (as mentioned on Piazza) they are simply passed through
- also, MAX_PID is guaranteed to remain between 0 - 10 as mentioned in the files
- the only external library used (other than the provided ones) was pthread.h
- RETRIES is the number of times send_packet() will retry until giving up
- the DIAGNOSTICS methods used attempt to emulate what was implemented in the provided demo (try should all be prefixed with "Driver:" as well)
- the code strictly adheres to the bounded buffers as well as the nonblocking desirability: PacketDescriptors are only used from the FreePacketDescriptorStore, a full waiting_buffer means that additional PacketDescriptors coming from the NetworkDevice will be discarded, and applications that do not reguarlarly call the *_get_packet() functions could lose recent packets
