# Coursework
This repository contains notable work from my classes at the University of Oregon.

## CIS 212 - Spring 2014
Learned Java and some basic Object-Oriented Programming principlies.

### SimplePainter
One of my assignments required me to create an application that captured mouse movement. I developed __SimplePainter__, a simple drawing program using a Swing GUI. Important notes:
* 4 different colors, 2 tools, and MouseMotionAdapter were implemented as per the requirements
* 3 sizes and MouseAdapter were also used
* brush color and brush size aren't displayed as plain-text (_yet!_)
* Main:107 non-zero weight was used to maintain a consistent layout
