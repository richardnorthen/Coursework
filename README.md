## Maze Solver in C and C++
An algorithm for traversing mazes implemented in C and ported into C++. Uses the wall follower method to navigate from start to finish, recording the moves needed to successfully complete the maze. The C++ implementation also prints diagrams for each step taken.

## Java Applications
Both of these applications were developed in 2014 and utilize the Swing toolkit to provide a GUI.

**SimplePainter** <br>
A simple computer graphics program that supports 4 diifferent colors, 3 brush sizes, and an undo function. Captures mouse movement and displays various statistics about the current canvas.

**DataManipulator** <br>
Generates up to 50,000 UUIDs in a list which can then be sorted using selection or merge sort. The GUI application is threaded to remain responsive while working in the background.

## Miscellaneous

**Website Monitor** <br>
Takes a list of websites with dates and stores them in an AVL tree for quicker searching and sorting. The data structure is implemented by me and my work is in **date.c** and  **tldlist.c**.

**Sample Network Driver** <br>
Simulates a network driver that stores and forwards incoming packets. The driver utilizes a bounded buffer and is non-blocking. My own work is in **networkdriver.c**.

**Palindrome Program in Haskell** <br>
A simple Haskell program that tests whether a given string is a palindrome. Demonstrates various functional programming techniques and their advantages in this context.

**Recursive Fibonacci Generator** <br>
Recursively generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. Written in y86 as an introduction the the x86 assembly language.
