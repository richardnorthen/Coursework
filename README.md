## SimplePainter
Assignment 4 in CIS 212 Spring 2014 required us to develop a Java application that captured mouse movement. I developed __SimplePainter__, a simple drawing program using a Swing GUI. Important notes:
* 4 different colors, 2 tools, and MouseMotionAdapter were implemented as per the requirements
* 3 sizes and MouseAdapter were also used
* brush color and brush size aren't displayed as plain-text (_yet!_)
* Main:107 non-zero weight was used to maintain a consistent layout
