submitted files: report.txt date.c tldlist.c

overall notes:
- both date.c and tldlist.c contain no print messages
- the gcc and cc compilers were used, with the flags -W -Wall (per the Makefile)
- the program output matches the expected output in both small.txt and large.txt
- valgrind reports no issues
- I did not break lines longer than 80 characters - hope this is alright

date.c notes:
- the algorithm for determining a leap year was found here: stackoverflow.com/a/11595914
- the datestr does not have to have leading 0's (so 1/5/111 will work)
- date_compare returns the exact number of days between the two dates (inclusive)

tldlist.c notes:
- static functions are defined at the top (with easy functions already declared)
- the TLD must be no more than 3 letters (per the Assignment)
- when converting the backing datastructure from a BST to AVL, both wikipedia.org and geeksforgeeks.org were used as reference material
- if none of the inputs are within the specified dates, the program will print "Unable to create iterator" since the list is empty
